Final Project
CART Classification Tree on Redwine Quality

Finished by:
    Chongyu Fang
    Shuhui Xiang


There are two source code files. We implemented both
CART Classification Tree and ID3 Classification Tree.

Put the train data "train.csv" and test data "test.csv" in the same
path of our source code files, then run the code.
Output will be the test accuracy rate, along with
how long it takes to get the results on your computer.
